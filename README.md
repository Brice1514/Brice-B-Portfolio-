## Project 1: Electronic Health Data Integration and ICD-10 Analytics (2014–2021)

**Tools:** R, SQL Server, Microsoft Power BI 
**Domain:** Health Data Engineering and Analytics

### Description
This project involved integrating inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department electronic health records from 2014 to 2021 into a single analytical database to support diagnosis-based analysis.

### Key Contributions
- Cleaned, standardized, and merged large-scale healthcare datasets across care settings using R  
- Designed and populated a relational SQL database for efficient querying  
- Queried ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes to generate analytic datasets  
- Developed Microsoft Power BI visualizations to surface key trends and insights from ICD-10 diagnosis data for dashboard reporting


### Outcome
The resulting database provides a robust foundation for population health analysis, utilization studies, and clinical or operational dashboards.

## Project 2: Heat-Related Illness Surveillance Dashboard (2023–2024)

**Tools:** Microsoft Power BI  
**Domain:** Environmental Health, Public Health Surveillance

### Description
This project involved updating and expanding an existing Heat-Related Illness (HRI) dashboard to incorporate data from 2023 and 2024. The dashboard supports public health monitoring of heat-related morbidity and enables timely situational awareness during extreme heat events.

### Key Contributions
- Integrated and validated multi-year HRI surveillance data
- Developed interactive visualizations showing temporal trends, geographic patterns, and demographic distributions
- Enhanced dashboard usability for public health practitioners and decision-makers

### Outcome
The dashboard provides an accessible and scalable tool for tracking heat-related health impacts and informing prevention and response strategies.

## Project 3: Disease Transmission Network Visualization

**Tools:** R (tidyverse, igraph, ggraph)  
**Domain:** Infectious Disease Epidemiology

### Description
This project visualizes person-to-person disease transmission using network analysis techniques. The resulting graph illustrates how cases are epidemiologically linked and how disease spreads through a population over time.

### Key Contributions
- Constructed transmission networks representing individual-level case connections
- Incorporated demographic characteristics (e.g., age, sex, risk group) as node attributes
- Produced reproducible R scripts for generating analytical and presentation-ready visualizations

### Outcome
The visualization supports outbreak investigation by identifying transmission clusters, high-risk connections, and overall spread dynamics.
